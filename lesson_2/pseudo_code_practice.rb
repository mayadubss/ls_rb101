# Pseudo Code Practice

# 1 A method that returns the sum of two integers
# Add the integers

# 2 A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all of those strings concatenated together
# join all of the strings in the array

# 3 A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
# Assuming starting with the first element
# Create an empty array
# create a counter
# iterate through the array
  # if the counter is even
    # append the element at the counter's index to the new array
# return the new array
